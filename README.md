# Java Hospital Management System

This is a simple Java-based Hospital management system developed as a university project during the second year (Semester 2) in the IT program.

## Project Overview
The system simulates various functionalities of a basic clinic environment including:

- Patient registration and record management using a linked list.
- Emergency case prioritization using a priority queue.
- Treatment history tracking using a stack.
- Doctor assignments and scheduling using a hash map.

## Technologies Used
- Java (Core concepts and data structures)
- Console-based application (No GUI)

## Main Features
- Add, update, and remove patient records.
- Display all registered patients.
- Emergency patient queue with priority levels (High, Medium, Low).
- Track and view treatment history.
- Assign doctors with department and working hours.

## Team
Developed as a **team effort with classmates** as part of the IT245 course.

## ðŸ“Œ Note
This project was created for academic and learning purposes.  
It demonstrates the practical application of data structures in Java programming.

## How to Run
Compile and run `Main.java` in any Java IDE or terminal with Java installed.
